This app is created using HTML CSS Javascript
To operate it:-
1. Create a user through sign up page.
2. Then with the Height and Weight you entered bmi gets calculated.
3. And based upon that BMI it shows recommendation of diet and workout.
4. There is a login page also but it is not working because there is no external database.
5. The app is also border line responsive.
6. Data shown in food page and workout page are fetched using api and filtered on the basis of bmi.
7. For the wearable device functionality it is not implemented.
8. After logging out the data is removed from the internal storage so you need to sign up again .
